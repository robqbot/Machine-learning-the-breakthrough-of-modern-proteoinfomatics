\subsection {Learning Methods}
By now, we have defined the objective function, which is a direct measurement of the fitness of our models. The purpose of model training is to make model more accurate in predicting outcomes, which can be achieved by minimising the discrepancy between current model prediction and historical data and do it over and over again until satisfaction achieved.
