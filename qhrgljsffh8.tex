\subsubsection{Actiation functions~\textit{g}}
The activation functions are critical component of ANN models, which simulate the transformation from input layer to output layer, that is generally non-linear in nature~\cite{LeCun_2015}. Various studies~\cite{Bengio_2012,Singh_2013} have demonstrated the importance of selecting proper activation function for a given scenario, which can lead to improved feature extraction. There are a few classes of commonly used activation functions as follows:
