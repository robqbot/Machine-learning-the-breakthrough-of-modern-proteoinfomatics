\subsubsection{Objective Functions}
An optimization objective function in machine learning is used to measure the difference between the predicted outcome and expected outcome, which can be optimized during training phase to increase the accuracy of a prediction. A typical objective function often composes of the regularization term and loss term. The collective efforts to generalize the prediction error is summarised as regularization term~\cite{goodfellow_2015}, the error term discribes the
