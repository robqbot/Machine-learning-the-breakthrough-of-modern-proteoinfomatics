\subsubsection{Objective Functions}
An optimization objective function in machine learning is used to measure the difference between the predicted outcome and expected outcome, which can be optimized during training phase to  better prediction. The collective efforts to generalize the underline data structure within training data is summarised as regularization term~\cite{goodfellow_2015}.
