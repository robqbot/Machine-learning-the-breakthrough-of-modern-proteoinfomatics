\subsubsection{Objective Function}
The ability of learning (i.e. training) of an ANN model 
An optimization objective function in machine learning is used to measure the difference between the predicted outcome and expected outcome, which can be optimized during training phase to increase the accuracy of a prediction. A typical objective function often composes of the regularization term and loss term. The collective efforts to generalize the prediction error is summarised as regularization term~\cite{goodfellow_2015}, the loss term describes the measured off-target discrepancy between prediction using model $f(x|\phi)$ (where $x$ is input vector and $\phi$ is model parameter matrix) and the actual target. A typical optimization objective function can have the form as:

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{Obj}(,y,\phi) = 
\end{equation}
