\subsection{Concepts of Machine Learning}
One of the learning algorithm is artificial neural networks (ANN) as demonstrated in Figure~\ref{147379}. The very first of ANN was proposed by~\citet{McCulloch_1943}, which was inspired by the structure of human neural connections. ANN model typically possess three structural layers, namely: one input layer, hidden layer(s) and output layer.
