\subsection{Concepts of Machine Learning}
One of the learning algorithm is artificial neural networks (ANN) as demonstrated in Figure~\ref{147379}. The very first of ANN was proposed by~\citet{McCulloch_1943}, which was inspired by the structure of human neural connections.

A typical ANN model construction possesses three structural layers, namely: one input layer, one or more hidden layers and one output layer. Each layer can have one or more nodes and each node is commonly referred as a neuron. Neurons in the each layer are either connected or partially connected with neurons at neighbour layers. The output value $O_i$ can be presented in inputs form as
$O_i = g( \sum_{j} W_{bj}(\sum_{i} W_{ai} * I_i)_j$
where $I_i$ represents the input nodes, $W_{ai}$ is the weight of each input node to derive hiden
