One advantage of back propagation algorithm is that unlike other method, it can operate on non-normalized input vectors although additional normalization step will generally improve performance. \cite{Buckland:2002} The main theoretical challenge with gradient descent back propagation is that during optimisation, the gradient descent can stuck at local minimum and unable to reach the global minimum, this particularly concerning when error function is non-convex and the error surface is extremely rugged. Nevertheless,~\citet{LeCun_2015} argued this concern is largely theoretical and it is very unlikely to occur in majority practical applications.
