\subsubsection{Training Algorithms}
Backpropagation algorithm was proposed by~\citet{werbos1975beyond}, which provided the fundamentals for training multi-layers networks in a computational efficient manner by propagating error term back through layers via modifying the weight of each node. 
\par
In back propagation often needs to summarise many tensors. To calculate each tensor seperately involve large expense of memory, in practise, a single buffer often
