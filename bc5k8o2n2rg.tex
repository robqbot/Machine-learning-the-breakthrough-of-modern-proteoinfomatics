\section{Training Platforms and Hardware}
The superior performance observed in recent years' deep learning is largely founded on the largely extended hidden layers and shear volume of artificial neurons. Both have put demanded for large computational resources. Given the nature of

Athough Tensorflow and Theano are at the core of modern deep neural network,
