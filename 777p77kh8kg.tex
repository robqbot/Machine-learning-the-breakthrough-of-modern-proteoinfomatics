Deep neural network has shown promising ability in pattern recognitions, particular visual interpretation.

The importance of the protein structure lies not only to the fundamental understanding of biological and pharmacological functions, but also have profound clinical diagnostic applications. Protein misfolding contributes to many high profile diseases including but not limited to circulatory malfunctions like sickle cell disease; chronic neural malfunctions like Alzheimer, Parkinson and Huntinton's disease; chronic autoimmune complications like cy 

\subsection{Protein Structure Prediction}
Predicting protein folding is challenging, largely due to it large degrees of freedom, the possibilities are astronomical for even a small protein. As Levinthal's paradox described~\cite{LEV69}, the protein folding possibility is so great that if a protein with 100 amino acid residues to explore all possible conformation sequentially but quickly before arrive to its correct 3D construction, time spent would surpass the age of the universe. Although early attempt by~\citet{Zwanzig_1992} that adopts physical energy bias modelling has bought the Levinthal's paradox to a conclusion, the accuracy and robustness of early models were not suitable for scientific purposes.
