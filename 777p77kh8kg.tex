\subsection{Protein Structure Prediction}
Predicting protein folding is challenging, largely due to it large degrees of freedom, the possibilities are astronomical for even a small protein. As Levinthal's paradox described,  possibility One of the current advancement in predicting protein 3D structures is delivered by AlphaFold
