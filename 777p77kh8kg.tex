\subsection{Protein Structure Prediction}
Predicting protein folding is challenging, largely due to it large degrees of freedom, the possibilities are astronomical for even a small protein. As Levinthal's paradox described~\cite{LEV69}, the protein folding possibility is so great that if a protein with 100 amino acid residues to explore all possible conformation sequentially before arrive to its correct conformation, time would surpass the age of the universe.   One of the current advancement in predicting protein 3D structures is delivered by AlphaFold
