\subssection{Regularization}

The main purpose of regularization term is to reduce model complexity and help to avoid model overfitting problem by penalising the overly complex models as shown in Figure~\ref{515752}. Over complexed models tend to capture more of the noise in the training dataset and generally are not perform well in prediction, therefore, a lot efforts has been initiated to address the model overfitting. There are a few types of regularization that are popular.
