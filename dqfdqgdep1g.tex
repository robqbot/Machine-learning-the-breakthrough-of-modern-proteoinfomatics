In this article, we have focused on the nitty-gritty of the fundamentals underline machine learning models, it is important to address that there is another critical part of machine learning applications: data collection and data manipulations. data collection and manipulations also significantly dictates the accuracy and robustness of the trained models. There are many technical aspects of
