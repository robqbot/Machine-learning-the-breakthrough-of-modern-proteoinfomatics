As large volume of biological data is becoming readily available, we need a new strategy to effectively analysis and generate new knowledge, machine learning particularly deep neural network offers promising prospect in this front. There are a few emerging applications including protein structure predictions from primary amino acid sequence information, which greatly expanded our understanding in biological processes and enhanced the pharmaceutical discovery. Although there are a few confronting issues still need to be addressed, including but  o

In this article, we have focused on the detailed fundamentals that underline machine learning models, it is important to emphasize that in addition to proper model selections, data collection and data manipulations are also critical perspective to achieving accurate and robust prediction. Data collection and manipulations are important in capturing the real representation of the underline modelling subjects and allowing reproducibility but minimising the chance of model overfitting, this subject is technical and challenging, although it is the focus of another article, it also important to appreciate the significance and integral part of the machine learning.
