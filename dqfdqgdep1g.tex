In this article, we have focused on the nitty-gritty of the fundamentals underline machine learning models, it is important to address that there is another critical part of machine learning applications: data collection and data manipulations. In addition to model construction, training and validation, data collection and manipulations also significantly tates the accuracy and robustness of the trained models. There are many technical aspects of
