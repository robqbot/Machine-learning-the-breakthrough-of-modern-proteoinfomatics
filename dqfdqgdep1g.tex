In this article, we have focused on the nitty-gritty of the fundamentals underline machine learning models, it is important to address that there is another critical part of machine learning applications: data collection and data manipulations. There are also many technical aspects of data collection and manipulations, although it is not the focus of this ar also significantly dictates the accuracy and robustness of the trained models. T
