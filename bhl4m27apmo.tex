\section{Introduction}

In the past two decades, high throughput proteomics pipeline have dominated the proteomics research skyline. With the development of soft ionisation, delicate material like protein/peptides are now able to be analysed precisely through mass spectrometry, which in turn Although the high-throughput

Machine learning generally includes three categories as supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. The supervised learning focus on reaching a targeted outcome through given features or attributes. Unsupervised learning on the other hand, focus on clustering and grouping. Reinforcement learning adopts various agents with decision matrices and reward function to master a given action; developing a winning algorithm for board games is a typical reinforcement learning like the famous alpha Go.
\par
Recently heated deep learning, largely due to its superior performance in image pattern recognition, is a type of artificial neural network, which belongs to the realm of supervised learning.
