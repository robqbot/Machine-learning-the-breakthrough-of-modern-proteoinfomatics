Machine learning is generally categorized into three categories: supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. The supervised learning focus on reaching a targeted outcome through given features or attributes. Unsupervised learning on the other hand, focus on clustering and grouping. Reinforcement learning adopts various agents with decision matrices and reward function to master a given action. Developing a winning algorithm for board games is a typical reinforcement learning task like the famous alpha Go.

\subsubsection{Supervised Learning}

Recent popularity of deep learning, which largely driven by its superior performance in image pattern recognition applications, is a type of supervised learning models. The supervised learning algorithms focus on de the relationship between input~\textit{x} and the
