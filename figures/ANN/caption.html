<div data-label="147379">An illustration of a typical ANN model. Each of the eight  variables are shown in the first layer  (labelled as X1-X8) and the response variable is shown in the far right  layer (labelled as ‘y’).  The hidden layer is labelled as H1 through  H10, which was specified using the&nbsp;<code>size</code> argument in the&nbsp;<code>nnet</code> function.  B1 and B2 are bias layers that apply constant values to the nodes, similar to intercept terms in a regression model.</div>
