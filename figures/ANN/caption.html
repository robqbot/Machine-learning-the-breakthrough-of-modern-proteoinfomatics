<div data-label="147379">An illustration of a typical ANN model. Each of the eight  variables  in the first layer  (labelled as X1-X8) are input layer. The output layer is shown in the far right   (labelled as ‘y’).  H1 through  H10 forms one hidden layer, although a more complex ANN model can have many hidden layers.  B1 and B2 are bias layers that are applied as constant values to the nodes, function is similar to intercept terms in a regression model.</div>
