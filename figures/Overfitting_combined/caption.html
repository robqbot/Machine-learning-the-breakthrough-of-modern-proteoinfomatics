<div data-label="515752">An example of underfitting and overfitting model. a) Models training resulton training dataset. b) Model fit on extended dataset. Degree three polynomial has more errors on training dataset, but has captured trends as shown on the extended dataset, on the other hand, degree 21 polynomial performed well on training dataset with low error rate but seems also captured substantial noise, which is a clear indication of model overfitting.</div>
