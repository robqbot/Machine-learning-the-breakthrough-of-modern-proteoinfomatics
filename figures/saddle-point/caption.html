<div data-label="555041">A saddle point illustration. Saddle point occurs more common in multidimensional space, where a point possesses contradictory curvature at a different plan. In the case illustrated, function f(x,y) is concave up in x-direction with positive eigenvalue in Hessian but at the same time, f(x,y) is concave down in y-direction with negative eigenvalue in Hessian. In other words, a saddle point&nbsp;occurs when such a point is&nbsp;</div><div></div>
