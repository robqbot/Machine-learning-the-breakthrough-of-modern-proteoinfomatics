<div data-label="555041">An illustration of some common challenges when optimising the objective function space. a) Saddle point occurs more common in multidimensional space, where a point possesses contradictory curvature at a different plan. In the case illustrated, function f(x,y) is concave up in x-direction with positive eigenvalue in Hessian but at the same time, f(x,y) is concave down in y-direction with negative eigenvalue in Hessian. In other words, a saddle point&nbsp;occurs when such a point is both a local minimum and a local maximum at different plans.&nbsp; b)&nbsp; Local Minima. Local minima can either direct training gradient towards a wrong direction if the local minima are not&nbsp;in line with global minima direction, which will result in&nbsp;suboptimum training performance, or model training can stick to local minima and not be able to reach global minima. This is particularly challenging when local minima attract severe penalty in cost function compare to global minima. c) Cliffs. Cliff regions characterized by its steep changes in gradient.&nbsp;Gradient-based model training algorithm can overshoot the desired target region all together if the optimisation space is not convex. d) Flat regions. Points at flat region have close to zero gradients and zero Hessian, this degenerate region is particularly hard for gradient-based numerical evaluation algorithm to navigate through.&nbsp;</div><div></div>
