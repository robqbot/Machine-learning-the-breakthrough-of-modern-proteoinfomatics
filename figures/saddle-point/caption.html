<div data-label="555041">A saddle point illustration. Saddle point occurs more common in multidimensional space, where a point possess contradictory curvature at different plan. In the case illustrated, function f(x,y) is concave up in x direction with positive eigenvalue in Hessian but at the same time, f(x,y) is concave down in y direction with negative eigenvalue in Hessian.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
