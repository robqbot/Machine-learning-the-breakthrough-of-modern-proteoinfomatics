<div data-label="555041">An illustration of some common challenges when optimising the objective function space. a) Saddle point occurs more common in multidimensional space, where a point possesses contradictory curvature at a different plan. In the case illustrated, function f(x,y) is concave up in x-direction with positive eigenvalue in Hessian but at the same time, f(x,y) is concave down in y-direction with negative eigenvalue in Hessian. In other words, a saddle point&nbsp;occurs when such a point is both a local minimum and a local maximum at different plans.&nbsp; b)&nbsp; Local Minima.&nbsp; c) Cliffs d) Flat regions. Points have close to zero gradients and Hessian matrix, therefore it is&nbsp;</div><div></div>
