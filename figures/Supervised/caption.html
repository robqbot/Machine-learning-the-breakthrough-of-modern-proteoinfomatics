<div data-label="412041">A generic workflow of machine learning. In both supervised and unsupervised learning, large emphasis  is on&nbsp; defining the model questions and collecting high quality observation data. Resulting models need to be validated on grounds that cover both accuracy and general representation of defined problem. The model training process  is iterative in nature and in many cases, models need to trained and validated numerious time before &nbsp;</div>
