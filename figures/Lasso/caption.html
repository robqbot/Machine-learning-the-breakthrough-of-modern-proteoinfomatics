<div data-label="542725">The solution contours illustration foL1 (Lasso) and L2 (rigid) regularizations in two dimensions, where Lasso contour has a diagonal distance equal to t and rigid optimum has a circular contour with radius is t.&nbsp; Compare to rigid regularization, Lasso has a sharp edge, which results in&nbsp;the square error function Obj to m the weight matrix w more easily to fall onto axes hence produce more sparse network.&nbsp;</div><div></div>
