<div data-label="963969">An illustration of various loss functions used in regression models. MSE, Huber and Log-Cosh are all continuous and at least one time differentiable, which allow easy evaluation of model fitness. In MSE loss, as prediction away from target 0, imposed penalty increases quadratically outlier severely, where as MAE, Huber and Log-Cosh are all less sensitive to n</div>
