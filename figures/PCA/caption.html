<div data-label="396105">An illustration of Principle Component Analysis (PCA) -&nbsp;unsupervised strategy. Dataset in this example is consist of 32 car models published in 1974 motor trend magazine. A total of 9 quantitative measures for each model in this dataset: fuel consumption (mpg), engine cylinders (cyl), engine displacement (disp), carburetors numbers (carb), output horsepower (hp), rear axle ratio (drat), gross vehicle weight (wt), acceleration time (qsec) and transmission gear numbers (gear). As in graph, the principal component analysis suggests that PC1 alone captures 63% variance in the dataset and PC2 captures 23% variance. As we can see, by reducing data dimensions from 9 to only two principal components, we captured 86% features in the dataset. It also worth noticing that original 9&nbsp;quantitative measures contr each principal component&nbsp;</div><div></div>
