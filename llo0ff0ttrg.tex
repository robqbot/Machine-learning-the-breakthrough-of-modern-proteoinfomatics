\paragraph{Deep neural network - Recurrent}
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is another class of neural networks, which have reputation in dealing with sequential data, particularly in places where data is independent to time steps. The connections between nodes in RNNs are not strictly unidirectional like in feed forward networks. In many cases, the connections

One of the distinctive advantages of RNNs comparing to feed forward networks is that the RNNs can handle inputs with different dimensionalities, which is achieved via recurrent state definition as following:

\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{S}_k = \mathcal{f}(\mathrm{S} \dotc )
\end{equation}

RNNs models can be trained via back propagation through time~\cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}, although some efficiency improved methods have been studied.~\cite{963769,neco.1989,Gomez:2008:ANE:1390681.1390712}
