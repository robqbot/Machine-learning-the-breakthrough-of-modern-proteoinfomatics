\paragraph{Deep neural network - Recurrent}
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) has reputation in dealing with sequential data, particular in places where data is independent to time steps. 


RNNs models can be trained via back propagation through time~\cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}, although some efficiency improved methods have been studied.~\cite{963769,neco.1989,Gomez:2008:ANE:1390681.1390712}
