\paragraph{Deep neural network - Recurrent}
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is another class of neural networks, which have reputation in dealing with sequential data particu, particularly in places where data is independent to time steps. The connections between nodes in RNNs 


RNNs models can be trained via back propagation through time~\cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}, although some efficiency improved methods have been studied.~\cite{963769,neco.1989,Gomez:2008:ANE:1390681.1390712}
