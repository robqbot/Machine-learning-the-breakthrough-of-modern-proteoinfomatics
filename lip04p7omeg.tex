\subsubsection{Common Deep Learning Architectures}

\paragraph{Deep neural network - Forwarding}
\subsubsection{Deep neural network - Recurrent}
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) has reputation in dealing with sequential data. 

RNNs models can be trained via back propagation through time~\cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}, although more efficient methods have been proposed.~\cite{963769}

\subsubsection{Convolutional neural network}
Convolutional neural network (CNN) has shown promising implementation in image recognition. The composition of a typical CNN consists several convolution layers and sub-sampling layers in tenden. Each convolution layer is a filter, commonly referred as kernel, which possess a few receptive fields and each is programmable through parameters.  
Convolution neural network has shown far superior performance in image recognition than all other algorithms to date.~\cite{Szegedy_2015}
