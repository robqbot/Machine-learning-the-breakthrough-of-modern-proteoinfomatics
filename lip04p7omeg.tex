Convolutional neural network (CNN) has shown promising implementation in image recognition. The composition of a typical CNN consists several convolution layers and sub-sampling layers in tenden. Each convolution layer is a filter, commonly referred as kernel, which possess a few receptive fields and each is programmable through parameters.  
Convolution neural network has shown far superior performance in image recognition than all other algorithms to date.~\cite{Szegedy_2015}
