  title = {{Searching for Activation Functions}},
  description = {The choice of activation functions in deep networks has a significant effect on the training dynamics and task performance. Currently, the most successful and widely-used activation function is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). Although various hand-designed alternatives to ReLU have been proposed, none have managed to replace it due to inconsistent gains. In this work, we propose to leverage automatic search techniques to discover new activation functions. Using a combination of exhaustive and reinforcement learning-based search, we discover multiple novel activation functions. We verify the effectiveness of the searches by conducting an empirical evaluation with the best discovered activation function. Our experiments show that the best discovered activation function, $f(x) = x \cdot \text{sigmoid}(βx)$, which we name Swish, tends to work better than ReLU on deeper models across a number of challenging datasets. For example, simply replacing ReLUs with Swish units improves top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet by 0.9\% for Mobile NASNet-A and 0.6\% for Inception-ResNet-v2. The simplicity of Swish and its similarity to ReLU make it easy for practitioners to replace ReLUs with Swish units in any neural network.},

  abstract = {For extreme events, estimation of high conditional quantiles for heavy tailed distributions is an important problem. Quantile regression is a useful method in this field with many applications. Quantile regression uses an L1-loss function, and an optimal solution by means of linear programming. In this paper, we propose a weighted quantile regression method. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to compare the proposed method with existing methods for estimating high conditional quantiles. We also investigate two real-world examples by using the proposed weighted method. The Monte Carlo simulation and two real-world examples show the proposed method is an improvement of the existing method.},

  author = {B.T. Polyak},
  abstract = {For the solution of the functional equation P (x) = 0 (1) (where P is an operator, usually linear, from B into B, and B is a Banach space) iteration methods are generally used. These consist of the construction of a series x0, âŠ, xn, âŠ, which converges to the solution (see, for example [1]). Continuous analogues of these methods are also known, in which a trajectory x(t), 0 â©œ t â©œ â is constructed, which satisfies the ordinary differential equation in B and is such that x(t) approaches the solution of (1) as t â â (see [2]). We shall call the method a k-step method if for the construction of each successive iteration xn+1 we use k previous iterations xn, âŠ, xnâk+1. The same term will also be used for continuous methods if x(t) satisfies a differential equation of the k-th order or k-th degree. Iteration methods which are more widely used are one-step (e.g. methods of successive approximations). They are generally simple from the calculation point of view but often converge very slowly. This is confirmed both by the evaluation of the speed of convergence and by calculation in practice (for more details see below). Therefore the question of the rate of convergence is most important. Some multistep methods, which we shall consider further, which are only slightly more complicated than the corresponding one-step methods, make it possible to speed up the convergence substantially. Note that all the methods mentioned below are applicable also to the problem of minimizing the differentiable functional (x) in Hilbert space, so long as this problem reduces to the solution of the equation grad (x) = 0.},
