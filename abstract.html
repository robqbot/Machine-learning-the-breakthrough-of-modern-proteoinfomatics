<div>Machine learning, particularly the deep neural networks have largely gathered public attention recently due to its promising performance in deciphering patterns and features from large and complex datasets. Proteomics is the science studying proteins and its properties, advancements in sequencing technologies and mass spectrometry in the past two decades have largely transformed the field to a data-intensive and data-driven discipline, consequently, it is ever more challenging to study the insights with growing volume information</div>
