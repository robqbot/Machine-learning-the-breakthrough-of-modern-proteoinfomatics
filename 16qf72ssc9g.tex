\subsubsection{Challenges in Model Training}

Optimization is traditionally very difficult task. Model training in machine learning avoids many difficulties by carefully construct objective function to be continuous, differentiable and convex. However, there are still a few common problems need to be discussed. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Ill conditioning\\
Ill conditioning is one of the most common challenges in numerical optimization. The condition number is a measurement of how sensitive the output of a model is to a small change in input. Commonly the condition number is used to measure the tolerance of a model to an input error.  In multi-dimensional space, it is common to have different curvature (defined by $2^\circ$) at different direction

Hessian matrix $\mathrm{H}$ is defined as Jacobian of the gradient, which represents curvature of the $\mathcal{Obj}(\phi)$ and takes form as 
    \item Saddel Points and Flat Regions\\
In high dimensional model trainings, saddle points are more common present than local extrems 
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{H}(f)(x)_{i,j} = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}f(x)
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
