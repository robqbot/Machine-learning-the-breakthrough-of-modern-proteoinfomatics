\subsubsection{Challenges in Model }

Optimization is traditionally very difficult task. Model training in machine learning avoids many difficulties by carefully construct objective function to be continuous, differentiable and convex. However, there are still a few common problems con
the ill conditioning is one of the most common challenges in the
