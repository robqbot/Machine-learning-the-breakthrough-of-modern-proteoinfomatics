\subsubsection{Challenges in Model Training}

Optimization is traditionally very difficult task. Model training in machine learning avoids many difficulties by carefully construct objective function to be continuous, differentiable and convex. However, there are still a few common problems need to be discussed. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Ill conditioning\\
Ill conditioning is one of the most common challenges in numerical optimization. In multi-dimensional space, it is common to have different curvature at different crosssection 
\end{enumerate}
