\subsubsection{Other Regularization Algorithms}

Dropout~\cite{JMLR:v15:srivastava14a} also known as ensumble method, which was used to be another powerful regularization method, the main reason for its rise to popularity was due to its simplicity yet efficiency and is one of the less computationally expensive regularization option. Dropout is used on fully connected neuron network and has the benefit to capture the randomness in the data structure. Nevertheless, due to recent surgent of modern convolutional architecture, the dropout almost goes out
