\subsubsection{Other Regularization Algorithms}

Dropout~\cite{JMLR:v15:srivastava14a} used to be another powerful regularization method, the main reason for its rise to popularity was due to its simplicity yet efficiency and is one of the less computationally expensive regularization option. Dropout is used on fully connected neuron network capture the randomness of the data
